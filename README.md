# pwrIPOR_delegation
 
This repo helps people figure out 2 things:
1. If I have pwrIPOR and multiple different staked ipTokens, what percentage should I delegate my pwrIPOR to each staked ipToken?
2. If I want to add or remove money from my pwrIPOR or staked ipTokens, how can I do it to maximize my APR?

When you run the 'main.py' file, a locally hosted Dash gets created as the front end.
There are 5 parameters you can edit.
 
1. Input ipUSDC Amount - this is the current amount of ipUSDC you own and stake (or are planning on staking) to IPOR's Liquidity Mining Program
2. Input ipUSDT Amount - this is the current amount of ipUSDT you own and stake (or are planning on staking) to IPOR's Liquidity Mining Program
3. Input ipDAI Amount - this is the current amount of ipDAI you own and stake (or are planning on staking) to IPOR's Liquidity Mining Program
4. Input pwrIPOR Amount - this is the current amount of pwrIPOR (Staked IPOR) you own and plan on delegating to 1 or many of the staked ipTokens in IPOR's Liquidity Mining Program
5. Input USD to buy/sell - this is the amount of USD that you have any are planning on investing in the IPOR Liquidity Mining Program; either in pwrIPOR tokens or 1 of the ipTokens

Important Notes
1. If you just want to see how you should delegate your current pwrIPOR to your current ipTokens, just leave the "Input USD to buy/sell" Blank
2. If you do not want to ever own any of the ipTokens (like say I don't ever want to own USDT), then put a 0 in that Input box.
        If you have any number other than 0, like the default 0.01, the program will assume you will own that token and may allcoate to it

Please let me know how it works for you!
